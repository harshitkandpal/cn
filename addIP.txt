7b. Using netstat and route commands
The netstat command and route command are used to view and manage network routes. Here's how to perform specific actions.

1. View the current routing table using netstat
The netstat command shows various network statistics, including the routing table.

To view the routing table:

bash
Copy code
netstat -r
Output will look something like this:

sql
Copy code
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 ens33
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 ens33
Alternatively, you can also use the ip route command to view the routing table:

bash
Copy code
ip route show
2. Add a route using route
You can manually add routes to specific networks or hosts using the route command.

To add a route to a network (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24) via gateway 192.168.1.1:

bash
Copy code
sudo route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1 dev ens33
To add a route to a specific host (e.g., 192.168.1.100) via gateway 192.168.1.1:

bash
Copy code
sudo route add -host 192.168.1.100 gw 192.168.1.1 dev ens33
You can verify that the route was added by checking the routing table again:

bash
Copy code
netstat -r
3. Delete a route using route
To delete a route that was added, use the following format:

To delete the previously added network route:

bash
Copy code
sudo route del -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1 dev ens33
To delete a specific host route:

bash
Copy code
sudo route del -host 192.168.1.100 gw 192.168.1.1 dev ens33
4. Change the default gateway
The default gateway is the IP address that traffic is sent to if it has no specific route. To change the default gateway:

Delete the current default gateway:

bash
Copy code
sudo route del default gw 192.168.1.1 dev ens33
Add a new default gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.254):

bash
Copy code
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.254 dev ens33
Again, verify using:

bash
Copy code
netstat -r
