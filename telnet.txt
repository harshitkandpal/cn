This page provides a step-by-step guide for performing a remote login using Telnet. Here's a breakdown of each step in the process:

1. **Update the System and Install Telnet:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install telnet
   ```
   - These commands are used to update the package list and install the Telnet client on your system, allowing you to initiate a Telnet session to a remote server.

2. **Find the IP Address of the Remote Machine:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   - Running `ifconfig` will display the network configuration of your machine, including the IP address. You need to know the IP address of the machine you want to connect to for the Telnet session.

3. **Initiate Telnet Session:**
   ```bash
   telnet 172.16.20.180
   ```
   - Replace `172.16.20.180` with the actual IP address of the remote machine. This command initiates a Telnet connection to the specified IP address.

4. **Navigate to the Desktop:**
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```
   - This changes the directory to the Desktop on the remote machine.

5. **Create, Edit, and View a Text File:**
   - **Create a File:**
     ```bash
     touch fruit.txt
     ```
     - This command creates a new file called `fruit.txt` on the Desktop.
   
   - **Edit the File:**
     ```bash
     vim fruit.txt
     ```
     - This opens the `fruit.txt` file in the `vim` editor, allowing you to edit its contents.
   
   - **Write and Quit the Editor:**
     ```bash
     :wq
     ```
     - In `vim`, typing `:wq` saves the changes and exits the editor.

   - **View the File Contents:**
     ```bash
     cat fruit.txt
     ```
     - This command displays the contents of `fruit.txt` in the terminal.

6. **Exit the Telnet Session:**
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
   - This command terminates the Telnet session and disconnects from the remote host.

These instructions guide you through connecting to a remote machine, creating and editing a file, and then disconnecting using Telnet.
